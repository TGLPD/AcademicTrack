Project Statement: AcademicTrack

Problem Statement

Students often struggle to keep track of their academic performance across different semesters. Calculating GPA manually is error-prone, and keeping a physical record of grades is inefficient. There is a need for a centralized system where students can log their courses, record grades, and instantly view their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) to better plan their academic goals.

Scope of the Project

The project is a Java-based application designed to manage student academic records. It allows for the creation of student profiles, the addition of course details (credits and grades), and the automated calculation of GPA.

Target Users

Students: To track their own progress.

Academic Advisors: To review student performance (simulated via Admin view).

Educational Institutions: As a prototype for a larger student information system.

High-Level Features

Student Management: Create and manage student profiles.

Course Management: Add courses with specific credit values.

Grade Recording: Assign grades to specific courses.

GPA Calculation: Automated algorithm to calculate GPA based on credit weightage.

Academic Report: Generate a transcript-style summary of performance.
